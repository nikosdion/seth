  <description>"What would Seth Godin do?" is a simple Joomla! plug-in based on Seth Godin's
  idea to have a different user experience between "new" and "returning" visitors of your site,
  based on a cookie set in their browsers. This plugin will display a custom message to your
  new visitors. You can freely enter any message you please and set the time period to
  consider a user "new", e.g. consider him new during his first three visits. The message
  is displayed in single article view (on the top and bottom of the article text) without
  the need to use any special markup.
